# 🧮 Welcome to the Day-4 Digital Logic Circuits!
> **I'm the README.md file of this folder, here to guide you step-by-step!** 🚀  
This day focused on building a **2-bit Magnitude Comparator** circuit using fundamental logic gates on a **breadboard setup**, with simulation shown in Logisim for better understanding.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned on Day-4

The objective was to design a **2-bit magnitude comparator**, which compares two binary numbers and evaluates if one is **greater than**, **equal to**, or **less than** the other.

To build this circuit efficiently, I used **Boolean logic mapping** and minimized expressions for all three conditions. The actual circuit was wired manually using basic ICs and optimized for clarity and correctness.

## ⚙️ Apparatus Used

All circuit connections were made using **hardware components**. Here's what was used:

- ❗ **IC 7404** – NOT Gate  
- ➕ **IC 7432** – OR Gate  
- ✖️ **IC 7408** – AND Gate  
- 🧰 **Digital IC Trainer Kit ML-444T**  
- 🔌 **Breadboard and jumper wires**

These ICs were connected manually to realize the logic on physical hardware.

## 💻 Why Logisim Simulation?

> ⚠️ **Note:** This circuit was **not simulated originally**.  
It was implemented on **hardware** using physical ICs and a breadboard.  

However, to demonstrate and explain how the circuit works internally, I created a simulation in **Logisim**.  
This helps others understand the internal structure and how the gates interact.

## 📁 Folder Structure

This folder contains a total of **3 files**:

- 🖼️ **2 screenshots** – showing the comparator logic as built in Logisim  
- 🔌 **1 `.circ` file** – the Logisim simulation of the 2-bit comparator circuit  

---

## 🧪 Simulation Instructions

> You can open the `.circ` file using **Logisim**, and provide binary inputs to the two 2-bit numbers.

The circuit will display the output signals:
- A > B  
- A = B  
- A < B  

Use this only as a **reference** to understand what was wired in hardware.

## 🎯 **Final Takeaway**

This experiment helped me solidify concepts of:
✔️ Comparator logic design using AND, OR, and NOT gates  
✔️ Minimizing logic using truth tables and mapping  
✔️ Realizing hardware circuits with minimal ICs  
✔️ Using Logisim as a visualization tool, **not as the actual working medium**
