# ➕ Welcome to the Day-5 Digital Logic Circuits!
> **I'm the README.md file of this folder, here to guide you step-by-step!** 🚀  
This day was all about designing and simulating **4-bit Adder and Subtractor circuits** using Logisim. No hardware components were used — this was a **pure simulation-based experiment**.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned on Day-5

I explored how to construct:
- 🧮 **Half Adder** – using a mix of gates  
- 🧮 **Full Adder** – by combining two Half Adders  
- 🧮 **4-bit Adder-Subtractor** – using Full Adders and XOR-controlled subtraction logic

This helped deepen my understanding of **binary addition and subtraction at the gate level**, as well as the reusability of simple units (like Half Adders) in larger composite circuits.

## 💻 Simulation Details

This experiment was **completely simulated in Logisim**.  
No physical hardware (ICs, breadboards) was used.

The Logisim file `AdderSubtractor.circ` (note: 'A' and 'S' capitalized) contains all the implementations.  
You can open it and test each sub-circuit by providing binary inputs.

## 📁 Folder Structure

This folder contains a total of **4 files**:

- 🖼️ **3 screenshots** – showing:
  - Half Adder using basic gates
  - Full Adder using two Half Adders
  - 4-bit Adder-Subtractor  
- 📂 **1 `.circ` file** – the Logisim simulation file named `AdderSubtractor.circ`

---

## 🧪 Simulation Instructions

> Open the `AdderSubtractor.circ` file using **Logisim**.

Within the file:
- You’ll find Half Adder, Full Adder, and the complete 4-bit Adder-Subtractor modules.
- To test subtraction, use the XOR gate logic with a control input (1 = Subtract, 0 = Add).
- Try different 4-bit inputs to verify outputs.

## 🎯 **Final Takeaway**

This simulation taught me how:
✔️ Binary arithmetic works at the logic gate level  
✔️ Small modular units like Half Adders can be scaled to complex systems  
✔️ XOR gates help in toggling between addition and subtraction dynamically  
✔️ Pure simulation can sometimes be more efficient than hardware for early prototyping
