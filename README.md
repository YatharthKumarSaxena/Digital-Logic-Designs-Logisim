# Digital-Logic-Designs-Logisim

# 🔌 Welcome to the Digital-Logic-Designs-Logisim Repo!
> **I'm the README.md file of this folder, here to guide you step-by-step!** 🚀

This repository is a digital showcase of my practical journey through the **Digital Logic and System Design** course in the 3rd semester. Here, I've recreated and simulated a wide range of **combinational and sequential logic circuits** using **Logisim**, some of which were also **physically implemented on a Digital IC Trainer Kit** during college labs.

## 📖 **Introduction**
This repository includes 13 folders in total:
- **11 folders (Day-1 to Day-11)** represent daily lab sessions in which different digital circuits were implemented—either on **hardware kits** or in **Logisim**.
- **2 folders (Combinational & Sequential Circuits)** cover additional practice work where I explored theoretical concepts and implemented them as working circuits.

This work consolidates my hands-on learning and deep understanding of how fundamental gates, multiplexers, flip-flops, and other components form the building blocks of digital systems.

## 🛠️ **Lab Setup & Hardware Used**
The circuits in **Day-1 to Day-4** and **Day-10** were implemented on actual hardware using:

- 🔧 **Digital IC Trainer Kit ML-444T**
- 🧱 **ICs Used:**
  - `IC7400` – Quad 2-Input NAND
  - `IC7408` – Quad 2-Input AND
  - `IC7432` – Quad 2-Input OR
  - `IC7404` – Hex Inverter (NOT)
  - `IC7486` – Quad 2-Input XOR
  - `IC74153` – Dual 4x1 Multiplexer
  - `IC74107` – Dual JK Flip-Flop
- ⚙️ Breadboard, Connecting Wires, Power Supply

Due to hardware limitations on GitHub, physical circuit images are replaced by simulated equivalents in **Logisim**.

## 📁 **Folder Structure**
This repository contains **13 items** in total:
- 📂 `Day-1` to `Day-11` – Circuits implemented per lab session.
  - 🧪 Hardware-based circuits: **Day-1 to Day-4**, **Day-10**
  - 💻 Logisim-based simulations: **Day-5 to Day-9 and Day-11**
- 📂 `Combinational Circuits` – Practice circuits from topics like Adders, Subtractors, Encoders, Decoders, MUX, DEMUX, etc.
- 📂 `Sequential Circuits` – Flip-Flops, Registers, Counters, and custom Finite State Machines.
- 📝 Each folder contains a dedicated `README.md` explaining:
  - Circuit goal and logic
  - Screenshot of the Logisim circuit
  - Key components used
  - Circuit behavior and output analysis

---

## 🔄 **Simulation Tool**
All circuits were simulated using:

- **🧰 Logisim**: A graphical tool for designing and simulating logic circuits.
  - Open-source and easy to use.
  - Supports combinational and sequential circuit design.
  - Provides real-time testing and debugging environment.

You can open the `.circ` files in Logisim to test, run, and modify circuits live.

## 🎯 **Final Takeaway**
This repository is not just an assignment submission, but a **practical reflection** of what I learned in Digital Logic Design. Recreating each logic design in Logisim helped me build a strong foundation in:

- Logic gate behavior and interaction
- Circuit design patterns (e.g., MUX as universal gates)
- Sequential logic thinking and timing analysis
- Real-to-simulation transition from breadboards to virtual circuits

By documenting every part of this repo neatly with folder-wise `README.md`, I’ve ensured that any learner or enthusiast can **reproduce and learn from my digital logic implementations**.
