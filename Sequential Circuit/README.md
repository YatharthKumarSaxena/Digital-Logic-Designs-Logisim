## 📖 **Introduction**
After understanding how **combinational logic** works, I stepped into the world of **sequential circuits**, where memory and timing take center stage.  
This folder contains **17+ simulated sequential circuits** that I implemented in **Logisim** based on theoretical understanding from *Unit 3* of my Digital Logic course.

From **basic latches** to **counters**, **registers**, and even **memory cells**, I simulated each component by focusing on **industry-level design practices** like:
- Negative-edge triggered clocking 🕓  
- Active-low clear signal ❌  
- Master-Slave JK Flip Flop architecture 🧠  
- Gate-level optimization for minimum delay ⚙️

## 🧠 **Implementation Concepts**

### 🔁 Clocking Convention
All circuits use **negative-edge triggered clocks**, which is preferred in real-world synchronous systems to reduce chances of **clock skew** and **glitches**.

### ❌ Clear Signal Convention
I used **active-low clear signals** in all Flip-Flops and Counters. This minimizes accidental resets and aligns with hardware-level practices in chip design.

### 🧠 Master-Slave Architecture
Wherever required, I implemented **Master-Slave JK Flip-Flops** to overcome the **race-around condition**, especially when J=K=1.  
This ensured **predictable toggling** of output only on clock transitions.

### ⚙️ Low-Level Optimization
My aim was to use **minimum logic gates** without compromising behavior. Each circuit is optimized to reduce **propagation delay** and enhance **speed**.

## 🎯 **Final Takeaway**
Sequential circuits brought a whole new dimension to digital logic. Unlike combinational logic, **timing and state** became central here.  
Through this simulation journey, I understood not just how flip-flops work, but how they enable real-time memory storage, counting, and control.
